## Overview
For our project we have created a web application for a made up animal shelter 
using Java Server Faces and Postgres. 

## Running
1. Open NetBeans 8.2
2. Open the project
3. Select the 'Run' command from the IDE

## Features
1. Functional login and registration
-Passwords in user manual
2. Working nav bar
3. Animal management (adoption/personal information/medical history)
4. Employee management (viewing/adding)
5. Pet classes (timeslots/class descriptions/unique classes per user)

## Important Stuff
1. OmniFaces Library. We have included the OmniFaces Library in ```web/WEB-INF/lib```
   which must be added to the project under ```File->Project Properties->Libraries```
2. BootsFaces Library. Same as OmniFaces. Must be included.
3. JDBC Library is provided by NetBeans but should also be included.
4. CSS Errors. It is a known bug in NetBeans 8.2 that CSS is not properly parsed.
   To fix this error, open the CSS file, click the error button next to the line
   number of the error. Select the option that filters out all errors in the bootstrap
   folder.
