- Name:    Wile E. Coyote
- Species: Dog
- Sex:     Male
- Weight:  32.0
- AgeY:    67
- AgeM:    8
- AgeW:    3
- Color:   Brown

- Food:    Road Runners
- Breed:   Coyote
- Description: Wile E. Coyote is constantly trying to catch Road Runner, but he somehow always fails. He also stars in he and Road Runner's own shorts. He is usually shown ordering Acme products as he would normally do in most shorts. For instance, in the short Winter Blunderland, he orders an Acme product that makes the whole desert turn into an ice land. He also appears briefly outside of a short in Yosemite Sam's Blow My Stack at the anger management classes. Acme products that he ordered will be used in such plans to catch Road Runner but always fails. A lot of the products have such advantages, though it always backfires on Wile E. He later appears in Point, Laser Point, where he is shown at Witch Lezah's counseling classes in the waiting room, and Sylvester starts to constantly bug him. In Rebel Without a Glove, he was shown trying to catch the Road Runner. He saw Bugs on the road and exchanged peace signs in passing. He appears again in Here Comes the Pig, where following another failed attempt to catch the Road Runner he pointed the lost rabbit (Bugs) the way back to the road.

I'm a pretty low maintenance guy who likes to look out the window, eat lots of food, and be spoiled beyond belief. I'm a sweet cat with my beautiful, chocolate coat that I wear ever so nicely! I know my breed says I'm a Domestic Shorthair, but I'm really a Havana Brown cat. Yes, very exotic, I know! Unfortunately that wasn't part of the choices in breeds so that's why I'm labeled the way I am. Anyways, if you're looking for a constant and always predictable, loving cat, pick me.
